# TL_US_Estimation_2022

For the Conterminous US###########################################################################
Use plotting_code_TL.py to compute and plot TL and compare it to the TL used by ASCE 7
-This code uses the .csv files modal_2s_conterminous.csv and modal_4s_conterminous.csv
--- those are the modal magnitude deaggregated at spectral periods of 2s and 4s, respectively
--- if you are interested in obtaining modal magnitude at other spectral periods and developing a .csv file, then check out Mw__US_deaggregation_2022 branch
-This code uses cb_2018_us_nation_5m.shp and cb_2018_us_state_5m.shp
--- those are the shape files used to plot conterminous US border and state borders, respectively

For Hawaii#######################################################################################
Use plotting_code_HI.py to compute and plot TL and compare it to the TL used by ASCE 7
-This code uses the .csv files modal_1s_HI.csv and modal_2s_HI.csv
--- those are the modal magnitude deaggregated at spectral periods of 1s and 2s, respectively
--- if you are interested in obtaining modal magnitude at other spectral periods and developing a .csv file, then check out Mw__US_deaggregation_2022 branch
-This code uses cb_2018_us_nation_5m.shp
--- this is the shape file used to plot the Hawaiian state border
